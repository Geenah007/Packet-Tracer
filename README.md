# Packet-Tracer
Packet Tracer projects consisting of Cisco Packet Tracer network architecture 


This network topology displayed in the videos fits the following requirements: 

• Each section (reception, design, workshop) has to be isolated (e.g. a reception computer should not be able
  to communicate with a design computer) = this is why the outcome in the video shows "unsuccessful" on the bottom right of the second video. This shows that this requirement is     fulfilled.
• Each section must have Internet connectivity. There is only one Internet access point.
• The printers in each section should be accessible over the network.
• The network in each section should be representative of the perceived network needs of the section.
• If DHCP is not used: The subnets appropriate for the associated sections are used.
o Each of the sections are isolated.
o The printers are accessible in their own sections.
o The network allows for the indicated growth, if needed, in an organsiation 
o All of the devices shown to ensure all network architects know what the network consists of.
o The network is capable of connecting to the Internet through a single fibre connection.
o For a random selection of devices: all of the devices are connected to the Internet gateway device.
